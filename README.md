![MindAssist Banner](public/assets/app-mockup.png)

## 🚨 The Crisis
In Sri Lanka, **22 million people** are served by only a handful of psychiatrists. Cultural stigma, language barriers, and a lack of accessible resources have created a silent epidemic. Existing apps are often English-only and Western-centric, failing to connect with the local context.

## 💡 The Solution
**MindAssist** is a clinically-grounded, culturally-adapted mental health platform designed specifically for the Sri Lankan demographic. It bridges the gap between professional care and the general public through accessible technology.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Tri-Lingual NLP:** Fully functional support in **English, Sinhala, and Tamil**.
* **Clinical Screening:** Integrated **PHQ-9 (Depression)** and **GAD-7 (Anxiety)** assessments to provide accurate initial screening.
* **SOS Protocol:** One-tap connection to the **1926 National Mental Health Helpline** with location-based hospital mapping.
* **Modified CBT:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy exercises adapted for Sri Lankan societal norms.
* **Privacy First:** Anonymous peer support and strictly local data handling.
